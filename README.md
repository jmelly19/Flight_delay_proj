# Flight_delay_proj
SQL database set around flights and delays 

This database was created to analyize the relationships between airline, airport and flight delays. I ran into a lot of different errors while doing this and spent countless hours getting this all put together. 
Altogether there are over 1,000,000 rows of data to query from dating back to 2017. It also includes 20 airlines and appox. 300 airports accorss the United States

I used the import wizard in MySQL Workbench to import all the data.
